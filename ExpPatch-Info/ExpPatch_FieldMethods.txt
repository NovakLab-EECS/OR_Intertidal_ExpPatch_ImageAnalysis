Name:  Experimental Patch Succession


Purpose: 
To investigate adaptive foraging by quantifying per capita attack rates (prey preferences) over time, as prey successional dynamics unfold.


Location: 
Yachats, Natural Bridge site.  
Three flat benches just north of Smelt Sands State Park.  (Park in public parking lot.)
In "mid-zone" (within Mytilus californianus zone)


Overview:
Create 16-18 1.5x1.5m mussel patch clearings.  
(Maybe: 8-9 re-cleared in winter.)


1. Friday July 5th (and July 8th, if needed) - Patch locations
Locate and mark two corners of each patch (top left, bottom right when facing landward) using large 4-½ inch lag bolts and pink cable ties.


Needs:
        Drills
        Drill batteries
        Drill bits
        Two 1.5x1.5m PVC quadrats
        4-½ inch lag bolt (bring 40+)
        Anchors (40+)
        Speed wrenches
        Cable ties
        Crow bars
        Needlenose pliers
        Headlamps


2. Saturday 6th thru 12th - Patch clearing
Photograph patch (Ensure that camera is set to C1 setting (highest resolution images))
Whelk density comparison: In each patch, in 3 haphazardly located 0.5x0.5m quadrats:
        Photograph quadrat
        Count whelks
        Estimate % mussels (large and small) and % barnacle (species-specific) cover.
        Clear quadrat, placing all whelks and mussels into numbered bucket 
(for later counting of the whelks)
Clear the whole patch
Needs:
        1.5x1.5m PVC quadrats
        0.5x0.5m quadrats
        Camera
        Crowbars
        Buckets (numbered)
        Datasheets
        Wire brush (?)


3.  Thursday July 11-12 (20-21, if needed) - Quadrat placement
Mark 9 permanent 25x35cm quadrats within each patch
        Haphazard "regular" spacing on flat surfaces.
        Mark 2 corners with small 2-½ inch screws (top-left and bottom-right corners).
        Numbered washer in top left corner
Needs:
        Drills (both)
        Drill bits
        Drill batteries (all of them!, fully charged)
        Small quadrat (25x35cm)
        Screws (2/plot * 9/patch = 324 => bring 350+)
        Anchors (350+)
        Numbered washers  (A1-A9, B1-B9, etc.)
        Speed wrenches
        Needlenose pliers
        
4. Saturday July 20 & 21 - Survey
Abundances:
        Photograph entire patch and all permanent quadrats
        Count prey in all quadrats from photographs
        Count whelks in all quadrats
        Count prey in 3 quadrats (randomly assigned, but same each time.  Assignment T.B.D.)
Feeding surveys:
        Survey whelks until 75 (100?) or more feeding observations have been made.
Needs:
        Datasheets
        25x35cm quadrat
Camera
Calipers
Notebook


5. Until succession is "done"
Resurvey every month.  See calendar.
